Comparison sorting algorithms ------------- Compare two items to see which one comes first and second
average time complexities  BEST EVER is O(n log(n)) bec of limited information
-Bubble sort - O(n^2) *
-Insertion sort - O(n^2) *
-Selection sort - O(n^2) *
-Quick sort - O(n log(n)) **
-Merge sort - O(n log(n)) **
